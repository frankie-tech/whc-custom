# whc-custom

A spin on the [wehatecaptchas](https://wehatecaptchas.com/) clientside JavaScript.

The goal of this script was to make the wehatecaptches JavaScript more customizable while also retaining the original spirit of the project. If you are thinking "This is something I could use in my own project," you would be wrong. I suggest highly you start off using the [source](https://wehatecaptchas.com/captcha.js) as a foundation. I __cannot__ guarantee this will work, and will __not__ be able to offer support for issues you run into.
